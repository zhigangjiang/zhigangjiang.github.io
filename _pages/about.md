<!-- I am currently engaged in 3D reconstruction and object detection at [Zeekr Auto](https://www.zeekrlife.com/). Before that, I researched room 3D layout estimation at [YiWo Technology](https://123kanfang.com/). -->
 
I obtained my master's degree from [East China Normal University](https://www.ecnu.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Jinhua Xu](https://faculty.ecnu.edu.cn/_s16/xjh2/main.psp). Before that, I received my bachelor's degree from [Fujian Normal University](https://www.fjnu.edu.cn/).

My research interests are in the area of computer vision, especially 360 panoramic vision and 3D vision.
